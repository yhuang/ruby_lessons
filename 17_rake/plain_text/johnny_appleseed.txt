Oh the Lord is good to me
And so I thank the Lord
For giving me the things I need
The sun and the rain and the apple seed
Oh the Lord is good to me
For every seed I sow
An apple tree will grow
And soon there'll be apples there
For everyone in the world to share
The Lord is good to me
Johnny Apple Seed
Amen
